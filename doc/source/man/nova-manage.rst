OPTIONS
=======

The standard pattern for executing a nova-manage command is:
``nova-manage <category> <command> [<args>]``

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories:
``nova-manage``

You can also run with a category argument such as user to see a list of all commands in that category:
``nova-manage db``

These sections describe the available categories and arguments for nova-manage.

Nova Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``nova-manage db version``

    Print the current main database version.

``nova-manage db sync``

    Sync the main database up to the most recent version. This is the standard way to create the db as well.

``nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows [--max_rows <number>] [--verbose]``

    Move deleted rows from production tables to shadow tables. Specifying
    --verbose will print the results of the archive operation for any tables
    that were changed.

``nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup [--transport-url <transport_url>]``

    Setup a fresh cells v2 environment; this should not be used if you
    currently have a cells v1 environment. Returns 0 if setup is completed
    (or has already been done), 1 if no hosts are reporting (and cannot be
